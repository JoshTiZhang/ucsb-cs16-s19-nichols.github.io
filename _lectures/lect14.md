## Code from lecture

<https://github.com/ucsb-cs16-f18-nichols/code-from-class/tree/master/11-20>

# Topics

* Thinking recursively about problems on sequences
* Recursion vs. iteration via examples: printing elements of an array in order, summing elements of a linked-list
* Order is very important: one line in the wrong spot makes you print the elements in reverse order
